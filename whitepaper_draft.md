## CSWG, PromiseGrid, and the Infrastructure Gap in Distributed Manufacturing

Working white paper by the Community Systems Working Group.

This white paper is for people working in fablabs, makerspaces, small shops, small manufacturing networks, and related projects. The question is how to scale down production coordination beyond what is already possible in large enterprises. The goal is more local, more collaborative, and avoiding dependence on fragile centralized systems. Our purpose is not to claim that we have the one true answer. It is to explain the problem we have been working on and describe PromiseGrid as one emerging technical response.

## Distributed Manufacturing Already Exists at Industrial Scale

Distributed manufacturing is not only a future aspiration. At industrial scale, it is already how much of the global economy works: long supply chains, specialized vendors, outsourced fabrication, contract manufacturing, logistics providers, and digital coordination across many sites.

The hard part is scale. ERP, EDI, MES, QMS, ISO 9000, vendor portals, and formal supply-chain standards already exist, but they are often out of reach below industrial scale. They assume budgets, staffing, process maturity, and institutional weight that smaller groups usually do not have.

## Why CSWG Matters in This Context

This is where the Community Systems Working Group, or CSWG, enters the picture. CSWG builds open-source infrastructure for groups, communities, and organizations that need shared software, shared infrastructure, and shared decisions without handing control to one operator. Its public goals are practical and recognizable to anyone who has spent time keeping a community organization running: reduce the workload of infrastructure, increase resilience, avoid the up-front cost of conventional system buildout, reduce dependency on third-party platforms, and decrease the bottlenecks and burnout that accumulate around a few key people. Those goals matter in many domains, but they are especially relevant in small-scale production communities, where shared equipment, shared knowledge, shared scheduling, and shared stewardship are common realities rather than edge cases.

## The Coordination Problem Underneath Production

The important point is that distributed manufacturing does not fail only when a machine breaks or a part is unavailable. It also fails when coordination breaks down. A shop can have skilled people, useful machines, and active community interest, but still struggle because the operational layer is brittle.

The questions are practical:

- Who can reserve which machine, and under what conditions?
- How are maintenance responsibilities tracked?
- How are shared inventories handled when different groups have different levels of access?
- How do several independent labs collaborate on production without one organization becoming the platform owner for everyone else?
- What happens when a key organizer steps back and tacit knowledge disappears with them?

These are not secondary administrative issues. In many communities, they are the main constraint.

## Why Existing Software Infrastructure Falls Short

Traditional software infrastructure often reproduces the very concentrations of power and fragility that distributed manufacturing is trying to avoid. A centralized SaaS platform may be convenient at first, but it often creates lock-in, opaque governance, and dependence on the priorities of a vendor or host organization. A self-hosted tool stack can solve part of that problem, but it frequently shifts the burden onto a handful of administrators who become permanent operators, gatekeepers, or points of failure.

For small fabs, the gap is also practical. Shop work is often coordinated through a patchwork of:

- spreadsheets, calendars, chat threads, and booking tools,
- file repositories, accounting systems, and inventory lists,
- machine interfaces and improvised approval processes.

Larger manufacturing software such as ERP or MES systems can assume budgets, staffing, process uniformity, and administrative control that shared community spaces do not have. Machine ecosystems may expose limited or vendor-specific integration points. Permissions rarely travel cleanly across sites. Work-order state, machine capacity, maintenance status, inventory commitments, and evidence of completion often remain trapped in separate tools.

In this sense, the challenge is not merely to choose better apps. It is to rethink the computing and protocol layer underneath the apps, so that distributed manufacturing networks can coordinate without turning one organization, vendor, or exhausted local administrator into the de facto center.

## PromiseGrid as a Response

PromiseGrid is one attempt to do that. The project is an experimental decentralized computing and coordination architecture for groups and communities that need shared software, shared infrastructure, and shared decisions without handing control to one operator.

For this audience, the important point is that PromiseGrid is not another shop app and should not be presented as a finished manufacturing platform. It is an infrastructure experiment beneath applications: a way to explore community-owned computation, explicit promises, narrow capabilities, consensus, auditable handoffs, and shared governance as lower-level building blocks. In PromiseGrid's framing, consensus and governance are not bolt-on features. They are basic system functions exposed upward to applications and, ultimately, to users and communities. That means the same mechanisms used to manage the grid can also be used by the organizations on the grid to manage shared resources, decisions, and collaboration.

## Promise Theory as an Important Foundation

[Promise Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise_theory), associated with Mark Burgess and collaborators, is one of the underpinning inspirations behind PromiseGrid. Promise Theory starts from a simple but powerful idea: an agent can only make promises about its own behavior. It cannot truly command another agent into reliability. Cooperation happens when different agents make and keep promises that others can observe, rely on, and respond to.

In practice, this means a person, machine, software service, shared space, or partner organization is best understood not simply as something to be controlled, but as a participant making certain commitments under certain conditions. That shift matters because distributed manufacturing rarely works through pure command. It works through negotiated cooperation across many semi-autonomous actors.

Promise Theory also helps clarify several ideas that are easy to blur in ordinary operations language. A promise is not the same as a demand. A request is not the same as compliance. A refusal or non-commitment is not automatically a failure. Trust is not global and abstract; it is local, relational, and built from experience of which promises are kept, broken, declined, or renegotiated.

This perspective provides practical models for manufacturing networks:
A partner may promise fabrication capacity, but within limits. A
machine in a fablab or makerspace may promise availability, but only
for trained and certified members.  Certification is itself a promise
that some sort of training has been accomplished. Promise Theory gives
us language for describing these realities honestly instead of hiding
them behind simplistic assumptions of centralized control.

## What a PromiseGrid Message Looks Like

It is useful to make this concrete. PromiseGrid messages are not just generic packets moving around a network. They are structured envelopes that identify what protocol is being spoken and what kind of promise is being made.

At a simple level, one active PromiseGrid pattern looks like this:

```text
grid([42(pCID), payload])
```

This is the compact form used in some constrained scenarios.

- `grid(...)`: says this is a PromiseGrid envelope
- `42(pCID)`: identifies the protocol specification being used
- `payload`: contains the actual message body defined by that protocol

For more expressive cases, a fuller envelope shape looks like this:

```text
grid([42(pCID), parents, payload, proof])
```

- `42(pCID)`: the protocol identifier
- `parents`: links to earlier related messages or objects
- `payload`: the content of the current promise
- `proof`: the signature or other proof material used to verify it

This matters because PromiseGrid is designed so that meaning is not hidden in a vague application layer. The protocol is explicit. The message shape is explicit. The relationship to earlier messages can be explicit. The proof can be explicit. That makes it easier to ask practical questions such as: who made this promise, what exactly was promised, what earlier commitment does this depend on, and what evidence supports it.

That protocol-level explicitness matters for manufacturing because many operational commitments need to be understood by tools, machines, people, and organizations at the same time. A machine access grant, a maintenance status change, a work-order handoff, an inventory reservation, or a capacity promise should not have to live only as an entry in one application's database or a message in one chat channel. The longer-term vision is infrastructure where these commitments can become portable, inspectable, and governed at a deeper layer.

The same `grid(...)` message bytes are also intended to be transport-agnostic. They can be carried by online transports such as TCP, HTTP, or WebSocket, and also by slower or more asynchronous paths such as version-control history, file transfer, or a thumb drive.

One concrete example from current work is an order-status message used in a constrained device setting:

```text
grid([42(pCID), payload])
payload = ["MSG", "gateway-bob", "m4-ivan", 1, "BT-1042", "created"]
```

In plain language, that payload says a sender is making a status promise about order `BT-1042`. Another message might acknowledge that status update. The point is not the syntax by itself. The point is that the message structure makes the promise legible.

## Technical Direction in Plain Language

In the current prototype architecture:

- Stage0 is a small installed `grid` bootstrap that can fetch, verify, approve, and start a fetched local runtime layer.
- Stage1 provides daemon roles, transport, CAS/VCS, parser/builders, capability checks, and app execution support.
- WASI/WASM remains one planned portable app/runtime profile under stage1, including WASM in browser tabs.

That portability matters because distributed production networks are unlikely to run on one standardized hardware footprint. A system like this must be able to span laptops, servers, browser tabs, phones, and low-cost devices such as Raspberry Pis.

The project also uses capability-based security, which is relevant because community production environments rarely fit cleanly into all-or-nothing permissions. In practice, a lab may need fine-grained, contextual access:

- one person can inspect a machine log but not modify policy,
- another can start an approved workflow but not any workflow,
- a visiting collaborator can contribute to a production task without inheriting broad administrative power.

A capability-oriented model is better suited to this kind of distributed trust than many conventional role structures.

The deeper manufacturing vision is not only cross-organization messaging, but protocol-level coordination that can eventually reach closer to machines and workflows themselves. A CNC router, material store, inspection step, maintenance role, or logistics handoff may each need to participate in a chain of machine-readable commitments. That does not mean every device becomes politically autonomous. It means the infrastructure should be capable of representing scoped authority, operational state, and verifiable promises in ways that applications and devices can share without a single platform owning the whole workflow.

Another important design choice is that PromiseGrid treats consensus, conflict resolution, and governance as system-level building blocks. This is where the project becomes more than distributed hosting. It moves toward what the project calls computational governance. The idea is not to automate community life into a rigid machine. The idea is to make coordination rules visible, inspectable, portable, and programmable enough that groups can share infrastructure without surrendering agency. In manufacturing terms, that could eventually mean that access to tools, task handoffs, maintenance obligations, approvals, or inventory commitments are not buried in email threads, private spreadsheets, or the memory of one coordinator. Instead, they can become part of a shared operational substrate that is understandable and adjustable by the community using it.

## Governance, Stewardship, and Shared Resources

This is also where PromiseGrid intersects with a deeper governance problem that many communities experience as a tragedy-of-the-commons problem. Shared resources are vulnerable when incentives, visibility, and accountability are weak. In a fablab context, that may look like neglected maintenance, overbooked machines, missing materials, undocumented modifications, or uneven participation in the less glamorous work that keeps a space functional. PromiseGrid is aimed at these kinds of shared-resource failures. Whether or not it ultimately succeeds, that target is important. It acknowledges that resilient distributed production requires more than peer-to-peer connectivity. It requires mechanisms for stewardship.

The work done by CSWG over the last couple of years can be understood as exploratory infrastructure work in exactly this space. The public CSWG materials point to PromiseGrid and related projects as the main focus of effort. The emphasis, at least from the outside, appears to be on conceptual groundwork, architecture, proof-of-concept implementation, and learning how a more community-operated computing substrate might behave in practice. That is a sensible stage for the project. It would be a mistake to present this as a finished manufacturing platform. It is better understood as an infrastructure experiment: a serious attempt to align computing architecture with the actual needs of decentralized communities.

## What This Could Mean for Decentralized Manufacturing

The most useful question is not whether PromiseGrid can already solve every operational challenge in a shared space or small production network. The better question is whether it points toward a class of infrastructure that decentralized manufacturing will increasingly need. If local production networks grow more capable, more collaborative, and more interdependent, they will need ways to coordinate across organizations without falling back on a central operator. They will need digital systems that can support shared stewardship without requiring uniform ownership. They will need tools that work across uneven hardware conditions and mixed technical capacity. They will need software that assumes plural governance rather than pretending it does not exist. That is the direction in which PromiseGrid is interesting.

This is worth discussing before the prototypes mature. These groups can test the assumptions early.

They can:

- explain what shared resource management feels like in practice,
- tell the difference between a promising systems idea and a tool that would survive a busy week in a shared space,
- spot governance friction early,
- articulate use cases that do not always appear in abstract technical discussions.

Those use cases include temporary machine access for visiting collaborators, cross-lab job coordination, accountable maintenance workflows, shared design and production handoff, and low-overhead collaboration between semi-autonomous groups. If PromiseGrid is going to become useful for these communities, those realities need to shape it.

## PromiseGrid as Enabling Infrastructure

One helpful way to think about PromiseGrid for this audience is as enabling infrastructure rather than end-user software. Its value, if it proves out, is not that it replaces every existing tool. Its value is that it could support a different way of composing tools, permissions, policies, and cooperative workflows across a distributed network. That matters because distributed production is rarely one workflow. It is many workflows crossing organizational boundaries: design files, inventory signals, training status, machine reservations, fabrication tasks, quality checks, shipping, documentation, and repair. Any digital substrate meant to support this world has to handle not just data exchange, but negotiated trust.

This is why open-source and community ownership are central rather than decorative. Small fabs should be able to inspect the rules they depend on, run infrastructure appropriate to their own scale, participate in shared protocols, and adapt governance to local realities. Without that kind of substrate, distributed manufacturing can remain technically distributed while still being coordinated through systems that communities do not meaningfully control.

## ATP, CTP, and Promise-Shaped Coordination

Conventional supply-chain language such as Available to Promise and Capable to Promise is relevant:

- Available to Promise, or ATP, is about whether inventory or supply is available to fulfill demand.
- Capable to Promise, or CTP, is about whether the production system has the capacity and capability to meet that demand under the required conditions.

Promise Theory provides a larger framework around those concepts. ATP and CTP can be understood not only as internal planning calculations, but as structured commitments made visible across a network.

In a distributed manufacturing ecosystem, the key question is not only whether one organization believes it can deliver. It is whether the relevant promises can be made clearly, shared appropriately, and trusted locally by others in the network. Those promises may involve stock, machine time, labor, certification, logistics, and follow-through.

Seen this way, PromiseGrid is not trying to replace manufacturing planning concepts with abstract philosophical language. It is trying to provide infrastructure where promise-shaped coordination becomes explicit at the protocol level. A material store can make an availability promise. A fabrication site can make a capacity promise. A machine or lab role can make a capability promise scoped to certain jobs, tolerances, or time windows. A logistics role can promise pickup, shipment, or confirmation. Other participants can accept, decline, verify, or route around those promises without pretending that one central platform has total authority over the whole network. That is where the connection to ATP and CTP becomes practically useful for independent fabs: promises can cross organizational and machine boundaries without requiring one owner for the entire coordination system.

## Tiny Demo Ideas for Distributed Production

The demos we present alongside this white paper should therefore be tiny, concrete, and immediately legible to distributed-production practitioners. They should not try to prove the whole architecture. They should simply make the infrastructure question visible.

### Distributed Machine Booking

One promising demo is a distributed machine booking scenario. Imagine two partner labs sharing access to a CNC router and a laser cutter. Instead of one lab owning the booking platform, each site runs a small node. A shared policy determines who can reserve which resources, under what conditions, and how conflicts are resolved. The demo would show a booking request, a conflicting request from another node, and a visible resolution path that reflects shared rules rather than unilateral admin override.

### Maintenance and Stewardship

Another strong demo is a maintenance and stewardship workflow. In many shared spaces, maintenance is everyone's responsibility in theory and no one's responsibility in practice. A tiny PromiseGrid-based example could show how a machine enters a maintenance-needed state, how restricted capabilities change automatically, how a task is offered to qualified stewards, and how restored availability depends on a transparent completion record rather than an informal message in chat. This would speak directly to the tragedy-of-the-commons framing in a context that readers will immediately recognize.

### Shared Inventory

A third useful demo is shared inventory or material allocation across small sites. A group of labs might want to pool visibility into available stock for certain materials or components without giving one party full control over everyone's data or decisions. The demo could show lightweight commitments: one site marks a quantity as available, another requests a portion for a job, and the system records the promise, reservation, and fulfillment trail. The point is not warehouse optimization. The point is making inter-organizational coordination legible and governable.

### Distributed Work-Order Handoff

A fourth demo, if we want one that feels especially close to production-by-the-masses, is a distributed work order handoff. One site starts a small manufacturing task, discovers a capacity bottleneck, and passes a subtask to another site with the right machine, certification, or schedule window. What should travel with that handoff is not only a file, but also the permissions, commitments, and state needed for the receiving site to act without a long trail of ad hoc messages. Even a very small mockup of this idea could help the audience see why a computing and governance substrate matters.

If we include a code-based demo, it should remain minimal and explanatory. A good pattern would be a short example that declares a shared resource, grants a narrowly scoped capability, proposes a state change, and shows how consensus or conflict handling is surfaced. The code does not need to impress anyone with complexity. It needs to help technical participants see that governance is being treated as executable infrastructure rather than as an external management layer. If we include a visual demo instead, it should favor process clarity over UI polish.

## Why This Matters

The broader implication of all this is that distributed manufacturing may succeed or fail on the quality of its invisible systems as much as on the quality of its visible fabrication tools. Machines, materials, and designs matter, but so do the digital structures that let communities coordinate without burnout, lock-in, or loss of autonomy. If the next generation of local production networks is serious about resilience, shared ownership, and cooperation across many independent groups, then infrastructure projects like PromiseGrid deserve attention even in their early stages. They are asking a foundational question: what would it take for communities not only to make things together, but also to own and govern the systems that make that cooperation possible?

## Invitation

We hope readers will follow the prototype work, share use cases, critiques, and design questions from their own communities and production work. The real measure of this work is not whether the architecture sounds elegant. It is whether these communities can use it to become more capable, more resilient, and more self-governing in the everyday work of making things together.
